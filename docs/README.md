The `LeadGenerator` agent utilizes advanced AI algorithms to identify potential influencers who align with your brand's values and campaign goals. By analyzing vast amounts of data across social platforms, this agent pinpoints influencers who have the reach, demographic engagement, and content style that best match your target audience. This ensures a high-potential starting point for campaign engagements.

# How Taitris Works
